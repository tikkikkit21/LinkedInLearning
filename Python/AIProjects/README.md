## Image Classification
- *TensorFlow* is an open-source library for AI/ML
- Focuses on deep NNs
- Allows user to build complex ML models
- High-performance runtim
    - Supports CPUs, TPUs, and GPUs
- To build our image classification model, we need to
    - Collect dataset of labeled images
    - Train model to predict new images
    - Predict the categories on new images

## Sentiment Analysis
- *NLTK* stands for Natural Language Toolkit
- Features
    - Text processing
    - Classification
    - Tagging
    - Parsing
    - Semantic reasoning
- To build our sentiment analysis model, we need to:
    - Preprocess text
    - Extract features
    - Train classifier
    - Evaluate classifier
