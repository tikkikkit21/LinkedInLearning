## Developing Your Ideas
### Know Your Audience
- First need to do some research about audience
- Answer 3 questions
    - Who are they?
    - What do you want them to do?
    - What questions might they have?
- This helps to tailor the presentation to have the biggest impact
- One strategy is to develop some personas for your audience
- Sometimes you might not know exactly who your audience is
    - May need to make an educated guess
    - A decent guess is better than no guess at all

### Developing Ideas
- Give yourself plenty of prep time for making the presentation
- Take some time before making the actual presentation
    - Make a plan for your presentation
    - Think about your audience
- Start off with brain dumping your ideas
    - Doesn't have to be organized
    - That comes later

### Moodboards
- Moodboards are collections of different assets
- Helps to visualize links and connections with the audience
- Some examples
    - Colors
        - What colors are associated with their industry
        - Colors for nice contrast too
    - Fabrics
        - Do they wear a particular fabric?
        - Ex: white collar vs blue collar
    - Imagery
        - What images are relatable
        - What sort of art might they hang in their homes?
    - Type/Fonts
- Helps improve the feel and look of the presentation

### Creating An Outline
- Treat the audience as the "hero" of your "story"
    - Introduce the hero
    - Take the journey
    - Look at the challenges they'll face and overcome
    - Happy ending
- Sticky notes are useful
