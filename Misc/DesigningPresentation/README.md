## Developing Your Ideas
### Know Your Audience
- First need to do some research about audience
- Answer 3 questions
    - Who are they?
    - What do you want them to do?
    - What questions might they have?
- This helps to tailor the presentation to have the biggest impact
- One strategy is to develop some personas for your audience
- Sometimes you might not know exactly who your audience is
    - May need to make an educated guess
    - A decent guess is better than no guess at all

### Developing Ideas
- Give yourself plenty of prep time for making the presentation
- Take some time before making the actual presentation
    - Make a plan for your presentation
    - Think about your audience
- Start off with brain dumping your ideas
    - Doesn't have to be organized
    - That comes later

### Moodboards
- Moodboards are collections of different assets
- Helps to visualize links and connections with the audience
- Some examples
    - Colors
        - What colors are associated with their industry
        - Colors for nice contrast too
    - Fabrics
        - Do they wear a particular fabric?
        - Ex: white collar vs blue collar
    - Imagery
        - What images are relatable
        - What sort of art might they hang in their homes?
    - Type/Fonts
- Helps improve the feel and look of the presentation

### Creating An Outline
- Treat the audience as the "hero" of your "story"
    - Introduce the hero
    - Take the journey
    - Look at the challenges they'll face and overcome
    - Happy ending
- Sticky notes are useful

## Design Essentials
### Layout
- Space has 2 sides
    - Positive: there's things in it
    - Negative: generally nothing there
- Balance is important for layout
    - Not that this does not mean centering everything
    - Balance is possible with uneven distributions
- Example:<br>![balance](images/balance.png)
    - Pink is positive space, blue is negative
    - The image looks balanced even though it's uneven distribution
    - The negative helps to support the positive

### Establishing a Layout
- General slides software provides support for basic layout
    - Horizontal/vertical
    - Relative to other objects
- A tip is to use the "rule of thirds"
    - Divides up the slide into a 3x3 grid
    - Trick is to make a 3x3 table and resize it to the whole table
    - You can add guidelines if the software supports it
- Each grid block helps give a better idea on object proportion
- Intersections are "action points"
    - Great for placing objects
    - Doesn't always have to be center, can just be touching it

### Type
- Types, aka fonts
- 2 types of fonts
    - Sans serif (ex: Arial)
    - Serif (ex: Times New Roman)
- Generally speaking, sans serif is good for headers and serif for paragraphs
    - However, paragraphs are rare in presentations
    - Free to use either font
- A trick for good header size is to zoom out of a presentation to 50%
    - Make sure the size is still legible
    - Can also view presentation on phone
- Another trick is to set header sizes relative to body text
    - Body text is a certain size
    - Ex: header is 1.25x the body and sub-header is 1.10x
- Type weights are also great for distinguishing between headers and body
    - Helps the audience to know which text is most important to focus on

### Bullets
- Bullet points are overused in presentations
    - Goal is to minimize text on slides
    - People use bullets to try and achieve that goal but it's still too much!
- Use no more than 5, 3 is ideal
- Make them short
- Animate them so they appear individually
    - One way is for past bullet points to have a faded font
    - People can still read them, they're just not in the spotlight anymore
- Save them for handout and takeaway

### Words
- People can't read or listen at the same time
    - If slides are too wordy, audience can't focus on your words
    - Leads to cognitive overload
- Bad things can result from wordy slides
    - People fall asleep
    - Stop paying attention since they think you're just going to repeat what
      they read

### Color
