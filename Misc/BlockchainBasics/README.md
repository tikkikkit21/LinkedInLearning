## Trust Over the Internet
### Risk Management on the Internet Today
- The internet has brought new trust issues
    - Fraud
    - Misinformation
    - Outages
    - Hacking
- Existing technology is able to help improve trust
    - 2FA
    - Better passwords
    - Biometrics
    - Firewalls
- Nevertheless, problems still arise
- Security and trust is fundamental for cryptocurrencies
- The way crypto ensures this is with the <u>distributed ledger</u>, aka <u>blockchain</u>
    - Distributed trust system
    - Uses communal verification
    - Turns trust into a software thing rather than a human thing

### Rethinking Traditional Client-Server Computing
- Databases store data in a structured or unstructured way
    - The foundation for almost all computing systems today 
    - Typically hosted in a high performance central computer
- The usual client-server design is a centralized design
    - Single location for all data
    - Each client talks directly with the center
- A more decentralized version splits the central hub into multiple nodes
    - Each node contains a unique set of the data
    - Clients talk like normally and are unaware of the underlying design
    - More complex, but more efficient and robust
- Databases also need to ensure everyone has the proper permissions for access
- A blockchain is essentially a new architecture for a database system
