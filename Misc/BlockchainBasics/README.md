## Trust Over the Internet
### Risk Management on the Internet Today
- The internet has brought new trust issues
    - Fraud
    - Misinformation
    - Outages
    - Hacking
- Existing technology is able to help improve trust
    - 2FA
    - Better passwords
    - Biometrics
    - Firewalls
- Nevertheless, problems still arise
- Security and trust is fundamental for cryptocurrencies
- The way crypto ensures this is with the <u>distributed ledger</u>, aka <u>blockchain</u>
    - Distributed trust system
    - Uses communal verification
    - Turns trust into a software thing rather than a human thing

### Rethinking Traditional Client-Server Computing
- Databases store data in a structured or unstructured way
    - The foundation for almost all computing systems today 
    - Typically hosted in a high performance central computer
- The usual client-server design is a centralized design
    - Single location for all data
    - Each client talks directly with the center
- A more decentralized version splits the central hub into multiple nodes
    - Each node contains a unique set of the data
    - Clients talk like normally and are unaware of the underlying design
    - More complex, but more efficient and robust
- Databases also need to ensure everyone has the proper permissions for access
- A blockchain is essentially a new architecture for a database system

## Blockchain Technology
### What Problems Does Blockchain Solve
- A core characteristic of databases is a central ultimate authority
- Weaknesses
    - Single point of failure
    - All power is held by the central authority
- The central authority typically introduces a lot of extra overhead
    - Need to ensure security and trust for transactions
    - Humans are the final arbiter of whether a transaction is valid
- Blockchain targets these problems to solve

### Bitcoin to Blockchain
- Blockchain started off as a supporting mechanism for a new digital currency
- Digital forms of currency can easily be copied and reused
    - Known as the double-spend problem
    - Removes all viability in digital currency
- Bitcoin became reality in 2009 as an open source project
    - Open-source is important
    - Transparency, community enhancements
    - Allowed other crypto to emerge as well
- Very unique compared to typically currency systems
    - Independent of banks or governments
    - Crosses borders
    - Person-to-person without intermediaries
    - No physical representations
- Traditional currency must meet 4 criteria to have value
    - Supply
    - Demand
    - Utility
    - Trust
- Bitcoin meets these criteria
    - Supply: a limited amount of Bitcoin are available (21 million)
    - Demand: as more are mined, it becomes more difficult and costly to mine another
    - Utility: Bitcoin can be used to purchase many goods/services
    - Trust: as more people use it, its credibility has improved

### Basics of Blockhain
- A blockchain is basically a distributed database
    - No central database or control
    - Each user interacts with their own copy of their database
- All transactions are visible to everyone on the network
    - Transparency improves integrity
- Multiple designated network participants ensures transaction is valid
    - Helps eliminate double-spend
    - Improves security
- All participants have a private/public key pair
    - Private is used to sign transactions
    - Public is used to identify source/destination
- Each transaction is like a block
    - Math is used to connect each block with its previous block
    - Interference with a single block will disrupt all blocks down the chain
- Miners solve these math problems to approve the transaction
    - Other miners test the proposed solution and decide whether to approve
    - Shows as their proof of work
    - Receives Bitcoin as a reward
- Blockchain is built on the 3 core principles
    - Network decentralization
    - Transition dependency
    - Proof of work

### Growth of Crypto Coins/Tokens
- Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency and is the most popular today
- A common alt to Bitcoin is Ether
    - Runs on Ethereum platform
    - Includes both crypto and application development
- Crypto coins are the cash equivalent to cryptocurrencies
- Crypto tokens are more versatile in their use and application
    - Security tokens: typically represents ownership stakes
    - Utility tokens: typically used for future products/services
- Cryptos can also be abused
    - Ransomware
    - Selling contraband on dark web
- Still a risky domain
    - Stability
    - Market acceptance
    - Reliability

### Role of Key Pairs
- Keys are required to interact in the blockchain network
- Decentralized system means there's no authentication or permissions
- Public key is generated from the private key
    - Public is like your delivery address
    - Private is like your digital signature
- Keys are stored in wallets
    - Software
    - Hardware
    - 3rd party exchange
- Wallets use keys to identify transactions you own
    - Don't actually store the cryptocurrency itself
- Keys use cases:
    - Send and receive transactions
    - Prove ownership without need for intermediaries
