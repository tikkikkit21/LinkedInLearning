git diff: displays changes

git stash: "puts code in pocket", basically saves changes without committing it
    pop: restores stashed changes
    save [name]: saves changes under a name
    list: displays stashes

git add -p: the "p" flag will display each individual change so you can decide whether to add to the commit

git reset --soft HEAD~1: useful for immediate commit (only use when commit hasn't been pushed to remote)

git log: displays log of commits
    --oneline: displays log in condensed view, each action is one line
    --graph: displays a graphical representation of other actions, like merging from branches

git commit --amend: technically a new commit, but basically overwrites the previous commit (works with pushed code)

git revert [hash]: undos the commit (shows up in log as a new commit)
