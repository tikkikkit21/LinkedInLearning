# LinkedIn Learning
This repo will just store all my notes and code from the different LinkedIn
Learning courses I've done. It'll just be a way for me to store and organize my
notes in one place while also sort of displaying all the different things I've
learned. It can also serve as a mini timeline of when I took each course and in
what order.

I will mainly be using Markdown (`.md`) files to take notes (some of the first
few notes are on code files or `.txt` files, I may convert them later). This is
a habit I got from taking my CS3304: Comparative Languages class. What I like
about Markdown is that it's a lot easier to take notes when it comes to computer
code. It's really hard to paste nice-looking code snippets in Google Docs, and
it's hard to organize English notes in a code file itself via comments. I feel
like Markdown just bridges the gap and I find it well-suited for my note-taking
needs.

Note: The `main` branch is where I store *completed* courses. If you want to see
courses I'm currently in progress of, check out the branches!
